#### Workshop-101
- **Overview** :
    -   The project focuses on automating the deployment of a server in the AWS Cloud using **AWS CLI**, **Docker Compose**, and **Terraform**. Terraform is used to define and provision the necessary infrastructure components, while Docker Compose is employed to manage the Docker containers for the server application. The AWS CLI is used for interacting with AWS services programmatically. By integrating these tools, the project aims to streamline the deployment process, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistency and scalability in the AWS environment.

- **Overview** :

  - This workshop will demonstrate how to leverage infrastructure as code (IaC) and DevSecOps patterns to automate, scale, and improve the security posture of cloud infrastructure and applications. We will create a pipeline that ensures our configurations are secure and compliant from code to cloud.
