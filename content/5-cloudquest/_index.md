1 - Cloud Computing Essentials : Create Amazon EC2 instances to run the computational modules for the island stabilization system. Each instance should be placed in a different Availability Zone in same Region. ![5][1]

2 - Cloud First: Migrate an existing website to static website hosting on  Amazon S3 to improve reliability ![5][2]

3 - Computing Solutions: Increate the size of an Amazon EC2 instance to provide better application performance ![5][3]

4 - Cloud Economics: Configure a price estimate for an architecture that uses a variable amount of Amazon EC2 instances based on peak usage time. ![5][4]

5 - Networking: Review and change VPC network configurations to fix a connection issue ![5][5]

6 - VPCs: Allow communication between application hosted in different VPCs by using VPC perring. The Marketing and Developer EC2 instances need to access the Financial Services Server in the Finance department's VPC. ![5][6]

7 - Database: Improve the operational efficiency of databases by using multiple Availability Zones and a read replica. ![5][7]

8 - Security: Use IAM to provide work permissions to engineers by using group settings and the least privilege principle. ![5][8]

9 - File Systems: Deploy and maintain a file systems infratructure that is accessible form three different servers. ![5][9]

10 - NoSQL: Craete a database to help our video streaming team track customer viewing behaviors from metadata, such as movies watched and device type ![5][10]

11 - Auto-healing and Scalling App: Create and configure an Amazon EC2 Auti Scaling group that follows scheduled scaling activities to add and remove EC2 instances. ![5][11]

12 - Highly Available: Increase website reliability by creating a highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones with load balancing and health monitoring. ![5][12]
