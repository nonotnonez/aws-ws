-  Infrastructure as Code (IAC): IAC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It allows you to automate the process of setting up and managing your infrastructure.

-  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): CI/CD is a set of practices and tools that enable development teams to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (Continuous Integration) and then automatically deploying those changes to production or other environments (Continuous Deployment). This helps teams deliver code changes more frequently, reliably, and efficiently.
